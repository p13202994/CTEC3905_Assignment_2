# CTEC3905_Assignment_2
This website is a single page site of my own portfolio and depicts my seconday job cum interest. It illustrates everything related to my iterest in brief.

# Navigation
The navigation of the site is very simple and easy.

The first section of the site just gives you the basic information about my services in the form of a slideshow.

The second section shows the name of the owner of the site and brief introduction to the person and picture.

The third section is divides into three categories(services) and each of them delivers the infortmation about the program.

The fourth section shows some pictures of the successful clients and when you hover over the picture it turns into coloured and shows the name and location of the person.

The final section is the contact page where I have added my address and phone number (not right info) and the google map.

In the header of the website I have added Facebook and Twitted links.

# Progress of the website
Whole information about developing this site is given in a word document which is also uploaded on github.
